# Instructions

In this lesson, you will modify the code in 'App.jsx' to 
show different elements at different routes using React Router.
The `Home` component should show at the `/` route,
the `About` component should show at the `/about` route, and the
`Contact` component should show at the `/contact` route. Finally, the
`NotFound` component should show at all other routes.

Once you are done, try creating a new component and showing it 
at a route of your choice.
